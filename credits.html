									<h3>Background</h3>
									<p>During our free time, we usually talk a lot about school, life, and other miscellaneous topics. 
									One of these topics we were talking about was about our school, and what we'd do to improve it.
									The first idea we had was advertising as this school needed more students. We realized the
									easiest way we could do this was by creating a website to promote it. After that, we started
									brainstorming ideas during our breaks.</p>
									
									<h3>Our Goal</h3> <!-- TODO: make something or story about it, dont need to be real --> <!-- use this to comment or note so when we work we know that to do -->
									<p>It was during one our classes where we were talking with one of our teachers after we had finished our schoolwork earlier.
									We decided to ask why there wasn't a website to promote this school, to which they replied with confusion since the school had
									never had a website in all their years of teaching in it. So at that moment, we agreed upon building our own. With the main
									goal for us being to attract more students in our class, making the school more lively.</p>
									
									<h3>Creation Process</h3> <!-- let me yap for this and you grammar fixing ok -->
									<p>During the start of our Mid-Semester Exams, Aditya was coding for the website during his free time. 
									The original process for the website had a lot of errors, mostly because he wasn't experienced enough 
									to create a responsive web design, completely ignoring any thoughts of implementing any firewalls. After he 
									was done, he asked me (Lionel) to check for any grammarical errors in his paragraphs, as well as write more
									information to the website. So we co-operated in creating this website, with Aditya focusing on coding the <stroke>design</strokes>
									and creating the script and backend script needed for the website. While I (Lionel) wrote the paragraph's your reading right now! </p>
									
									<p> The process wasn't easy, and they went through lots of trial and errors. At first, we didnt want to use html5 premade code but after
									noticing that our time in this school is coming to an end. We decided on it and we remade and rewrote the old website with what your 
									currently seeing right now!</p>
